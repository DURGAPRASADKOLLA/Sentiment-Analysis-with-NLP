1) Sentiment Analysis with NLP :
This project implements Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. It analyzes text data (e.g., product reviews or social media comments) and classifies them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments using machine learning.

2) Features :
Text preprocessing (stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, lemmatization)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
Model training using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
Optional: Save/load model using pickle

3) Dataset :
You can use any labeled dataset (CSV format) with at least two columns:
comment or review: the raw text
label or rating: the sentiment class (e.g., 0 = negative, 1 = positive)
Example dataset:
review	rating
"The product is great!"	1
"Not worth the price."	0

4) Technologies Used :
Python
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib / seaborn
