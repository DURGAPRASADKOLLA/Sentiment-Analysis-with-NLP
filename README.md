💬 Sentiment Analysis with NLP
This project implements Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. It analyzes text data (e.g., product reviews or social media comments) and classifies them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments using machine learning.

🚀 Features
Text preprocessing (stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model training using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

Optional: Save/load model using pickle

📁 Dataset
You can use any labeled dataset (CSV format) with at least two columns:

comment or review: the raw text

label or rating: the sentiment class (e.g., 0 = negative, 1 = positive)

Example dataset:

review	rating
"The product is great!"	1
"Not worth the price."	0
